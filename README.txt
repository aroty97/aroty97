Hello there...

Adelin Roty

This is my github, and I don't really know what I will do of it.
I refuse to use unecessary bloated fancy tools when programming (or in general when using a computer for professional reasons).
This is why this README file (and all other) is not written using .md, the .txt is perfectly enough seriously.

You may say I am kind of a purist, which would be right.
When you use a tool (or equivalently a program, programming language, piece of software,...), you should know it very well in order to avoid any stupid bugs.
So the fewer tools you have the better you know them, and .txt are versatiles enough to contain any text-related file (such as README, AUTHORS,...).

----------------------------------------

What you can find in my github

1)
I guess this github will host most of my research-related projects, which will mainly be clones of my local git repositories.
I use version control for numerical simulations, embedded electronics codes, and scientific reports or articles.

2)
Keep a copy of my config files (I am running linux, and try to live in the terminal), in order to carry the most important part of my home on my back.
Other private personnal things in my home are kept elsewhere.

3)
Notes from my journey through computing : what I learn from the tools I use, important commands, options and goals of programs I use, etc.

Ps : 
One day, I will live in my terminal for professional usage of my computer.
I should be prepared when this day will come.
